     * the DnD drop location, it should query the table directly to

     *         // so render it specially, perhaps with a different color
     *     }
     * </pre>
     * <p/>
     * During a printing operation, this method will be called with
     * <code>isSelected</code> and <code>hasFocus</code> values of
     * <code>false</code> to prevent selection and focus from appearing
     * in the printed output. To do other customization based on whether
     * or not the table is being printed, check the return value from
     * {@link javax.swing.JComponent#isPaintingForPrint()}.

     * @param table      the <code>JTable</code> that is asking the
     *                   renderer to draw; can be <code>null</code>
     * @param value      the value of the cell to be rendered.  It is
     *                   up to the specific renderer to interpret
     *                   and draw the value.  For example, if
     *                   <code>value</code>
     *                   is the string "true", it could be rendered as a
     *                   string or it could be rendered as a check
     *                   box that is checked.  <code>null</code> is a
     *                   valid value
     * @param isSelected true if the cell is to be rendered with the
     *                   selection highlighted; otherwise false
     * @param hasFocus   if true, render cell appropriately.  For
     *                   example, put a special border on the cell, if
     *                   the cell can be edited, render in the color used
     *                   to indicate editing
     * @param row        the row index of the cell being drawn.  When
     *                   drawing the header, the value of
     *                   <code>row</code> is -1
     * @param column     the column index of the cell being drawn
     * @see javax.swing.JComponent#isPaintingForPrint()
