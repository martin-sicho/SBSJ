## SBSJ - Simple Backup System in Java


### Introduction
This is a school project on which I would like to learn the Java language. It will be a simple backup system 
that will in its simplest form take care of mirroring directories to one or more backup locations specified by the user. 

It will start off as a very basic console application that will be able to take a few arguments from the user 
and perform backups on demand. Then I would like to add a simple GUI for ease of use.

Please, note that this project was mainly created for educational purposes
and is therefore under heavy development so it may contain a lot of bugs and unresolved issues.
If you're looking for some serious backup software, you should seek it elswhere.
However, you are more than welcome to look around and I will be glad for any comments or questions regarding the project.

For more details see the project's [Wiki](https://github.com/martin-sicho/SBSJ/wiki "SBSJ Wiki").

### Current State of the Project
Right now I am happy to announce that I have something that could be called version 1.0. You can check the release [here](https://github.com/martin-sicho/SBSJ/releases "SBSJ v1.0").
