## SBSJ - Simple Backup System in Java
---


### Introduction
This is a school project on which I would like to learn the Java language. It will be a simple backup system 
that will in its simplest form take care of mirroring directories to one or more backup locations specified by the user. 

It will start off as a very basic console application that will be able to take a few arguments from the user 
and perform backups on demand.

Hopefully, as I learn new stuff, more functionality and automation will be added to the application.
